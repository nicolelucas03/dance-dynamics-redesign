## Project Overview :dart:
This project is a brand and website redesign for Dance Dynamics, a local ballet school based in Jackson Heights, Queens, NYC. The original website provides useful information but lacks modern design principles and accessibility standards. This redesign aims to modernize the user experience, improve site structure, and provide a more visually compelling platform that reflects the schoolâ€™s vibrant community and mission.

## Tech Stack :computer:
- **HTML5**- semantic markup and clean structure
* **CSS3**- custom styles with a focus on layout, color paletter, and typography

## Goals of the Redesign :wrench:
- Improve visual hierarchy and readability
- Use a cohesive color scheme and typeface that matches the school's identity
- Reorganize content for better user navigation and access to key information
- Ensure the redesign follows basic accessibility standards
